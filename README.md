# critter-chronologer




In this project we design and implement the data model for Critter Chronologer,
a Software as a Service application that provides a scheduling interface for a small business that takes care of animals. 
This Spring Boot project will allow users to create pets, owners, and employees, and then schedule events for employees to provide services for pets.


This applications that read and write to relational databases using both the Java Persistence API (JPA) and SQL. 
Use standard design patterns to make our persistence layer easy to test and integrate with a Spring Boot application.
